We are a young **value driven start-up** that was founded after participate in the [GXC International Virtual Innovation Challenge](https://www.hm.edu/en/international/projects_1/gxc/gxc_virtual_innovation_challenge.en.htm). 

The **goal of the challenge** provided by the multi-sport event [European Championships Munich 2022](https://gxc-int-innovation-challenge21.github.io/gxc-team-21/) had been to motivate their visitors and spectators to do more sports and inspire them to lead more active lifestyles, creating a positive impact for local sport clubs and society as a whole.

After aligning our team, we started with a deep research on environmental/sustainability issues of sport events, reasons why people to join local sport clubs, motivation of visitors and numerous of interviews with potential visitors/spectators we created following **storyboard** for our product.

# Boostive - Connect to sport events and local sport clubs

Boostive is going to motivate the users by providing different activities and try out stages for different sports at sport events or local sport clubs. Moreover, users will be motivated by gamification through comparison of their sport stats with other users. Additionally, Boostive provides the unique opportunity to gather coins while taking part in official activities provided by sport events. By redeeming those coins sport products and sustainable items can be bought in the reward shop.

**All those features will boost all users to be more active and connect to new sport communities.**
